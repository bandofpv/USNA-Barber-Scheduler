## Story

As Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, we are required to keep our haircuts within regulation. This being said, we have to get our hair cut at least every two to three weeks depending on how close you get your cut. A common issue we face to get a haircut on campus is waiting in super long lines. The only way to avoid waiting in line is to schedule an appointment via the [schedule portal](https://www.usnabsd.com/services/barber-beauty-shop/barber-beauty-shop-scheduler/). This however, only allows  you to schedule two weeks in advance and there's a chance someone already booked an appointment at the same time you desire. Midshipmen are often times so pre-occupied with school that it's hard to remember to book a haircut appointment, and you find yourself having to wait in line to get a last minute cut. I personally found this to be of great annoyance and it usually interfering with my already busy schedule.

The solution to this is to create a program that can automatically schedule appointments for you. The usage is simple, just enter the date and time of your appointment into the [dates.txt](https://github.com/bandofpv/USNA_Barber_Scheduler/blob/main/dates.txt) file and let the script run on a remote server. Doing so allows you to block out appointment times months in advance and never have to wait in line for a haircut.
